## Remote Jobs Scraper from `remoteok.io`.

#

As I write this program, I am actively looking for a job, ideally a remote one.

I discovered an excellent website, `remoteok.io`.

I consider myself as a Python Developer and seeking for an entry-level job in Tech.

I scrape the website mentioned below to get the position jobs which are interesting for me.

The program should be able to send a notification to my phone using Pushbullet.

#

I schedule my program `main.py` as a Cron Job with `crontab` to run everyday at 5PM.
To do that, enter the following command into a terminal:

`crontab -e`

`0 17 * * * python3 full-path/to/my/program.py`
